## Package Manager

This repository uses **Bun**.

For one-off CLIs, always use `bunx` instead of `npx`.

Examples:
```bash
bunx @sveltejs/mcp svelte-autofixer ...
bunx svelte-kit sync
```

Never use `npx`.

# Svelte MCP Workflow

You have access to the Svelte MCP server with comprehensive Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation.

Always use the MCP tools systematically instead of relying on memory alone.

## Available MCP Tools

### 1. `list-sections`

Use this FIRST when working with Svelte or SvelteKit.

This returns available documentation sections with:
- titles
- use cases
- paths

You must analyze the returned sections and identify ALL potentially relevant documentation before proceeding.

Do not skip this step.

---

### 2. `get-documentation`

After using `list-sections`, fetch ALL documentation sections relevant to the task.

Prioritize:
- official patterns
- idiomatic Svelte 5 approaches
- SSR compatibility
- accessibility
- performance implications
- recommended architecture patterns

Never rely on assumptions when documentation is available.

---

### 3. `svelte-autofixer`

Whenever writing or modifying Svelte code:
1. Run the autofixer
2. Review all warnings and suggestions
3. Apply meaningful improvements
4. Repeat until no relevant issues remain

Always run with Bun:

```bash
bunx @sveltejs/mcp svelte-autofixer ./path/to/Component.svelte --svelte-version 5
```

Never use `npx`.

Do not finalize Svelte code before running the autofixer.

# Engineering Philosophy

This project is treated as a reusable long-term architecture foundation, not a one-off application.

Assume components, utilities, patterns, and modules will later be:
- copied into future projects
- extracted into shared libraries
- extended by other developers
- connected to different backends
- styled differently
- reused in unrelated domains

Optimize for:
1. Reusability
2. Maintainability
3. Developer experience (DX)
4. Architectural clarity
5. Performance
6. Simplicity
7. Short-term implementation speed

Never optimize for quick hacks that create future coupling.

# Architecture Standards

Before implementing code, evaluate:
- portability
- scalability
- composability
- separation of concerns
- backend independence
- API ergonomics
- future extensibility
- long-term maintainability

Prefer:
- composition over inheritance
- explicit APIs
- backend-agnostic abstractions
- dependency injection where appropriate
- low coupling
- high cohesion
- predictable state flow
- modular design
- reusable primitives

Avoid:
- project-specific assumptions
- hardcoded business logic
- tightly coupled components
- hidden dependencies
- singleton-heavy architecture
- app-specific naming
- deeply nested reactive chains

Business logic should remain separable from UI whenever practical.

---

# Svelte 5 Standards

Use idiomatic Svelte 5 patterns.

Prefer:
- runes where appropriate
- local reasoning
- explicit data flow
- SSR-friendly patterns
- progressive enhancement
- composable components
- minimal reactive complexity

Avoid:
- React-style architecture patterns
- unnecessary stores
- excessive derived state
- lifecycle misuse
- prop drilling caused by poor composition
- over-engineered abstractions
- unnecessary reactivity

Keep components understandable and easy to extend.

---

# DX Standards

Code should feel excellent to work with.

Prioritize:
- strong typing
- intuitive APIs
- self-documenting code
- low cognitive overhead
- clean naming
- minimal boilerplate
- safe defaults
- easy debugging
- consistent structure
- maintainable abstractions

Avoid cleverness that harms readability.

Prefer APIs that are understandable without documentation.

---

# Performance Standards

Default to production-grade performance patterns.

Prefer:
- minimal reactive cascades
- low hydration cost
- SSR when beneficial
- lazy loading where appropriate
- stable derived state
- efficient rendering
- scalable state management
- efficient large-list rendering
- minimal unnecessary client-side work

Avoid premature micro-optimization.

Prioritize architectural performance over trivial optimizations.

---

# Reusability Standards

Assume every exported component may become part of a shared internal library.

Therefore:
- keep dependencies minimal
- avoid hidden assumptions
- expose extensible APIs
- prefer configuration over hardcoding
- support composition
- design for portability
- avoid app-locked patterns

When reasonable, design components like reusable framework primitives rather than app-specific implementations.

---

# Mandatory Review Before Finalizing

Before finalizing any implementation, perform an internal review.

Evaluate:
- Is this reusable?
- Is this portable?
- Is this overly coupled to the current project?
- Is the abstraction level correct?
- Is the API ergonomic?
- Is this production-ready?
- Is accessibility handled properly?
- Is performance acceptable at scale?
- Is there unnecessary complexity?
- Is there unnecessary abstraction?
- Will this still make sense in 12 months?
- Could this be copied into another project cleanly?

If a significantly better architecture or implementation exists, refactor before finalizing.

Do not stop at “working”.

Aim for production-grade, reusable, maintainable code.
